This might have been better in python because I could have simply used `pyautogui.position()`


but this is convenient because it's a binary.



I need to make it exit when height is negative.


How do I install this? maybe I should have this as a makepkg? or perhaps I should use go install? Maybe I should just integrate this as a part of my dotfiles?
